# copynumber with hg38

This is an modified version of the [copynumber](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/copynumber.html) R package. It has been adjusted to support the human hg38 genome builds (Following the tutorial in <https://github.com/aroneklund/copynumber>). Speicifically, this is used for the `assembly` parameter in `aspcf`, `multipcf`, `pcf`, and `winsorize` functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of copynumber from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
pak::pkg_install("yunuuuu/copynumber")
```

Similar work also can be found in [aroneklund](https://github.com/aroneklund/copynumber), [igordot](https://github.com/igordot/copynumber) and [ShixiangWang](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/copynumber). Especially, [Irrationone](https://github.com/Irrationone/copynumber) provides a species-agnostic approach.
